# Log Streamer

This tool allows you to stream logs from a Railway deployment and save them to a text file.

## Prerequisites

- Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your machine
- Railway CLI tool installed on your system and available in the system's PATH

## Usage

1. Clone or download the Log Streamer Java project to your local machine.

2. Open the project in your preferred Java development environment.

3. Specify the path where you want to save the log file in the `logFilePath` variable of the `LogStreamer` class:
   ```java
   String logFilePath = "logs.txt";
   
Please note that this solution assumes you have the necessary permissions to execute the Railway CLI command and write to the specified log file. Make sure you have the required access rights for a successful execution.

Take a look at the Railway CLI for reference to all use cases that may be implemented with this case and any in the future: https://docs.railway.app/develop/cli
